**Informal Intro -**
DBMS course was the most important subject in my semester 5th of engineering. It deals with how databases work and the art behind storing and retrieving data onto these databases.
We were instructed to apply our knowledge and build a project showcasing what all we learnt in the course. Our lecturer for the course was our HOD hence we definitely had to work a lot harder than we intended to 😅😅😭
After brainstorming and researching, building a task manager application using flask was the idea that we landed upon. 
We(me and my team-mates) took inspiration from people who built projects on similar lines.

The objectives of the Task Master system include: 

🔵 Efficient Task Management: To provide a platform for users to efficiently manage, prioritize, and organize their tasks. 

🟣 User Authentication: Implement secure user authentication to ensure data privacy and protect user accounts. 

🟠 User-Friendly Interface: Design an intuitive and visually appealing graphical user interface (GUI) to enhance the user experience. 

🟡 Task Tracking: Enable users to track task progress, set due dates, and receive reminders. 




In conclusion, Task Master is a web application designed to help users efficiently manage their tasks and boost productivity. 
With a user-friendly interface and essential task management features, it offers a convenient solution for organizing daily responsibilities. 
By providing a secure and personalized environment for users, Task Master empowers individuals to stay on top of their tasks and make the most of their time.
